# Websocket Chat

# Objective

- This is a guided coding interview
- Ask as many questions as you need
- Use your resources (look at documentation or google)
- There is no perfect answer

# Task

You will need to create a websocket chat. It should look vaguely similar to whatsapp in that whenever you get a message, you know who it is coming from. Everything you need to complete a chat is within this repository. You should not add anything unless you wish to use a different frontend framework (vue, angular, vanilla, etc)

# Installation

This is a monorepo using turbo repo

cd into each app directory

```
cd ./apps/client/

cd ./apps/server/
```

and run however you wish to install its dependencies `yarn / npm / pnpm`

Then install in the root directory using `yarn / npm / pnpm`

# Development

After installation you will see a dev script. This dev script runs dev servers of your apps directory seperately. So the client and server will be running at once in one terminal.

run `yarn|npm|pnpm run dev` to start the dev server
